<!--1. Removed Doctype from the end of the doc. we only need 1
    2. added <html> to the doc because it was missing. Set lang to en to reduce warnings
    3. surrounded "For Doggies" with <p></p> because it was missing
    4. fixed the head: changed src to href, added title.
    5. moved the h1 out of the head and into the body-->
